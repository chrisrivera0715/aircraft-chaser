The U.S. Air Force is out to get you and you need to survive for as long as you can. 
The purpose of Air Defences is to avoid incoming missles. The score is measured in seconds so your goal is to avoid missles for as long as you can. Your health will commence at a full 100%, and will deminish 10% by each missle that hits you. Considering that each missle that hits you will cause malfunctions to your helicopter, there are opportunities to redeem yourself. Every 15 seconds, a small repair logo will appear on your screen and if you hover your helicopter over to the repair logo, your health will increase by 10%. However, the repair logo will only be availble for 5 seconds, and if you miss it, you will have to wait another 15 seconds for the next one. 
Missles will continue to follow you, and more missles will appear so long you do not lose. Every 10 seconds, you will have the opportunity to place a 'fake helicopter' (counter measures), by clicking on the mouse. When you place the fake helicopter, the missles will follow it for 5 seconds, which allow you enough time to get away. After those 5 seconds are over, the missles will return to follow you. If the missles have hit the fake helicopter, those missles are now gone, but if they do not reach the fake helicopter, then they come to follow you. Again, once you have placed a missle you will not be able to place another one until after 15 seconds (5 seconds that the fake helicopter lasts, plus the 10 second interval)
Once your score has reached 0, a game over screen will appear with your current score, your best score, the repairs you were able to get, the counter measures (fake helicopters placed), and a chance to play again. 


* Note that the mouse cursor is your control, and the helicopter will follow it.
